                Cyprus Homes is a new project that aims to make the renting process easier for students and people looking for accommodation on the island.
                It will comprise both free (to register) listings of properties and paid, where you can search by filtering criteria such as location, price,
                number of bathrooms, and bedrooms. The whole idea behind Cyprus Homes is to be able to connect house owners with renters in a more convenient way.
                We are an online service that will simplify the search process for apartments on the island by letting you set your desired criteria.
                Perhaps what we care most about at Cyprus Homes is helping out house owners who have just listed their property or those who don't have websites but want to get renters registered on our website.
                Cyprus Homes is a platform where students and individuals can search for their desired rented apartment. House owners can also post their apartments for rent. We are an organization that is committed to enabling seamless, safe, and transparent communication between House Owners and Students. Specifically, we focus on student housing in Cyprus areas.
                Each day our team of specialists creates new rental opportunities in order to provide the best accommodation services in a personalized manner to students.
                Cyprus Home is a platform where students and individuals can search for their desired apartments. House Owners can also post their apartments for rent. The Cyprus Homes team is made up of three members: Ioanna, Savvas and Nikos. Between the three of us we have over 15 yearsâ€™ experience in the online property industry. We are experts in our field and understand how frustrating it can be to search for a place to live in a new city without any knowledge of the neighborhoods or real estate market; or worse still, to not see anything available that fits your budget, space requirements or style preference. We believe that all students deserve the opportunity to find their perfect home and we aim to help them with this aspiration by providing an affordable solution.
                We hope you'll find something on our site that will suit your needs!
